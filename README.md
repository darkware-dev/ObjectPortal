# Bag Of Holding

BagOfHolding is a somewhat simple library aiming to provide a set of functionality
useful for automatically loading dependencies or simply retrieving objects based on
some contextual characteristic. It aspires to support JSR 330 interactions, but in 
the meantime it uses the same annotations to be either familiar or super-annoying
(take your pick).
